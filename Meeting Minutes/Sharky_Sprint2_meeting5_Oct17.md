2. Add a button "select your team" with a drop down menu showing existing team names. (Raghda)
3. When the student inserts their team name, it asks which member they want to evaluate (from a list of the members in their team). (Raghda)
4. When they select a team member's name, and then click on the "evaluate button", it redirects them to the assessment page. (Shaili)
